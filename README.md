**Setup Instructions for OpenNebula**

In this repository installation instructions for the OpenNebula Cloud Computing Platform (https://www.opennebula.org) will be provided. This installation should work on CentOS 7 and a Single Server Setup, but should be easily extendable to a multi-server-setup.

It is based on the Tutorials on  [CentOS OpenNebula Quickstart](https://wiki.centos.org/Cloud/OpenNebula/QuickStart) and [OpenNebula Documentation](http://docs.opennebula.org/5.4/deployment/index.html).

The scripts are currently under development.
